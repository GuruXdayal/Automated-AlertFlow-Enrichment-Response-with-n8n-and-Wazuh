# ⚙️ Project Overview — **AlertFlow: Enrichment & Response with n8n**

> **A modular SOC automation system** that integrates alerts, APIs, and response mechanisms to enrich, triage, and act on security events in real time.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal
The project’s goal is to address critical pain points faced by SOC analysts — particularly **alert fatigue** and **prolonged investigation cycles**.  
By orchestrating **automated enrichment, triage, and response workflows** using n8n, AlertFlow significantly reduces *Mean Time to Triage (MTTT)* and accelerates incident resolution.  

> 🧠 *Empowering SOC teams with scalable, low-code automation that streamlines repetitive tasks, enhances context, and improves operational efficiency.*

## 🔍 Core Objectives
- Automate **alert enrichment** using external threat intelligence APIs.  
- Connect **Wazuh alerts** to **n8n** for real-time correlation and response.  
- Trigger **automated remediation** workflows based on rule-based events.  
- Send enriched reports and action summaries to **Gmail** for visibility.

## 🌐 Key Highlights
- 🧩 **Modular Workflow Design** – Reusable and extensible n8n nodes for different alert types.  
- ⚡ **API-Based Enrichment** – Integrated with VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, and similar sources.  
- 🔄 **Seamless Alert Pipeline** – From Wazuh → n8n → Gmail (reporting).  
- 🧠 **AI-Assisted Configuration** – Prompt-engineered automation design and troubleshooting.  
- 🛡️ **Low-Code SOC Integration** – Demonstrates how open-source tools can replicate enterprise-grade SOAR behavior.

## 📈 Scope & Future Enhancements
- **Current Coverage:** Enrichment & automated response for *malicious file alerts*.  
- **Planned Enhancements:**  
  - Add network-based detections (DNS / C2 communications).  
  - Integrate Slack / Teams alerting for SOC notifications.  
  - Map enrichment actions to **MITRE ATT&CK** techniques.
